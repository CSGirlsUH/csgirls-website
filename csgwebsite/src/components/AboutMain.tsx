            In August 2013, Computer Science Girls (CSGirls) was created as a
            platform for students to meet, discuss, and celebrate their love for
            computer science. Today, CSGirls is known for cultivating bright,
            talented professionals and upholding relationships with top
            employers in the country.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-6">
            CSGirls was founded on the principles of promoting a safe
            environment for students and recognizing excellence within the
            technology community at the University of Houston. Our main
            objective is to guide women in technology; however, we welcome
            people from all backgrounds. In line with our universityâ€™s values,
            we strive to create a diverse and inclusive community for our
            members to promote fellowship.
